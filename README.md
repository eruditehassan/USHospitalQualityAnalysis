# USHospitalQualityAnalysis
Data of over 40,000 hospitals in the US was analyzed to determine the quality of hospitals based on different factors

The data for this project comes from the Hospital Compare web site (http://hospitalcompare.hhs.gov)run by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The purpose of the web site is to provide data andinformation about the quality of care at over 4,000 Medicare-certified hospitals in the U.S. This dataset es-sentially covers all major U.S. hospitals.  This dataset is used for a variety of purposes, including determiningwhether hospitals should be fined for not providing high quality care to patients (seehttp://goo.gl/jAXFXfor some background on this particular topic).
